** E-COMMERCE SALES DATA ANALYSIS **
The E-commerce dashboard is related to amazon sales.In this project we typically include charts, graphs, 
tables, and other visual elements that enable users to quickly and easily understand the orders, sales, 
and discount by country in the data.

**WEATHER API **
A weather API (Application Programming Interface) is a tool that allows developers to access weather data and integrate it 
into their applications or websites. Weather APIs typically provide real-time or historical weather data for a specific 
location or region, such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and humidity. Open Weather Map API: provides 
current weather data, hourly and daily forecasts, and historical weather data.
** CAMPUS PLACEMENT PROCESS **

This project is aimed at developing an online application for the Placement Dept. of the college. The system is an online 
application that can be accessed throughout the organization and outside as well with proper login provided. This system 
can be used as an application for the PO (Placement Officer) of the college to manage the student information with regards 
to placement. Students logging should be able to upload their information in the form of a CV. Visitors/Company 
representatives logging in may also access/search any information put up by Students
